Readme for Exploring Multimodal Interaction with Virtual Pets in VR

Project Overview:
-----------------
This research project investigates how users interact with virtual pets in Virtual Reality (VR) using unimodal or multimodal interfaces, including controllers, gaze, and speech. The study aims to analyze how these interaction methods affect user experience, engagement, and emotional connection with a virtual pet dog in a minimalist VR environment. Conducted as part of a Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) study, the project explores applications in entertainment, therapy, and companionship. The experiment involves 3 participants and uses a Unity VR core starter scene with a simple room, basic objects, and a sky background to focus on pet interactions. Results will be documented in a comprehensive PDF report.

Additional Information:
------------------------
-The project is developed using Unity and the Oculus Quest 2 VR set for the development of the 	virtual reality experience. The main components include utilizing Unity 3D for environment and interaction design, and Oculus SDK for the integration of VR features.

Key aspects of the project include:

-Exploring how people interact with pets in VR through different modalities such as controllers, gaze, and speech.

-The experiment will include mockups and descriptions of the independent and dependent variables involved in the VR interaction study.

-The final deliverable will be a detailed PDF report that includes an analysis of the experimentâ€™s results, project details, and references to updated articles.

-If you encounter any issues or have questions, please feel free to reach out via email at rocarrol@colostate.edu or through the Overleaf link provided for collaboration on the document.
